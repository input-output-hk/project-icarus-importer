# Project Icarus Importer 

Icarus, a reference implementation for a lightweight wallet developed by the IOHK Engineering Team. This code base can be used as a point of reference to enable developers to create their own secure light and mobile wallets for Cardano. Icarus is a fully open-source code base that will be the first step in a range of open source initiatives to provide developers with a suite of tools to integrate with Cardano.

Icarus Importer allows wallet users to access blockchain data.
